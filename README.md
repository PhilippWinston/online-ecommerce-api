  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  
  After cloning the repository into your local directory, open it in your markdown editor of choice and in the terminal run `npm I` this will install all of the dependencies needed. Next you will need to copy the .env example in the route directories and name it `.env`, fill out the username and password of your choice and then run in the terminal `mysql -u -p` with your credentials. Next youâ€™ll run `source mySQL/schema.sql;` to initialize the database and then to populate it with data use `quit` to get out of mySQL and in the terminal run `npm run seed`
    
  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
  
  Run `NPM start` in the terminal to start the server and then open Insomnia, from there you can test the API routes from `http://localhost:3001/api/categories`
